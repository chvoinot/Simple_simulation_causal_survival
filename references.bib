abstract = {Summary. When comparing survival times between two treatment groups, it may be more appropriate to compare the restricted mean lifetime, i.e., the expectation of lifetime restricted to a time L, rather than mean lifetime in order to accommodate censoring. When the treatments are not assigned to patients randomly, as in observational studies, we also need to account for treatment imbalances in confounding factors. In this article, we propose estimators for the difference of the restricted mean lifetime between two groups that account for treatment imbalances in prognostic factors assuming a proportional hazards relationship. Large-sample properties of our estimators based on martingale theory for counting processes are also derived. Simulation studies were conducted to compare these estimators and to assess the adequacy of the large-sample approximations. Our methods are also applied to an observational database of acute coronary syndrome patients from Duke University Medical Center to estimate the treatment effect on the restricted mean lifetime over 5 years.},

We focus on causal inference of differences between t-year absolute event risks in a situation with competing risks. We derive doubly robust estimation equations and implement estimators for the nuisance parameters based on working regression models for the outcome, censoring, and treatment distribution conditional on auxiliary baseline covariates. We use the functional delta method to show that these estimators are regular asymptotically linear estimators and estimate their variances based on estimates of their influence functions. In empirical studies, we assess the robustness of the estimators and the coverage of confidence intervals. The methods are further illustrated using data from a Danish registry study.},

abstract = {Summary. AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) randomized trial 021 compared the effect of bactrim versus aerosolized pentamidine (AP) as prophylaxis therapy for pneumocystis pneumonia (POP) in AIDS patients. Although patients randomized to the bactrim arm experienced a significant delay in time to POP, the survival experience in the two arms was not significantly different (p= .32). In this paper, we present evidence that bactrim therapy improves survival but that the standard intent-to-treat comparison failed to detect this survival advantage because a large fraction of the subjects either crossed over to the other therapy or stopped therapy altogether. We obtain our evidence of a beneficial bactrim effect on survival by artificially regarding the subjects as dependently censored at the first time the subject either stops or switches therapy; we then analyze the data with the inverse probability of censoring weighted Kaplan-Meier and Cox partial likelihood estimators of Robins (1993, Proceedings of the Biopharmaceutical Section, American Statistical Association, pp. 24–33) that adjust for dependent censoring by utilizing data collected on time-dependent prognostic factors.},

abstract = {In observational cohort mortality studies with prolonged periods of exposure to the agent under study, it is not uncommon for risk factors for death to be determinants of subsequent exposure. For instance, in occupational mortality studies date of termination of employment is both a determinant of future exposure (since terminated individuals receive no further exposure) and an independent risk factor for death (since disabled individuals tend to leave employment). When current risk factor status determines subsequent exposure and is determined by previous exposure, standard analyses that estimate age-specific mortality rates as a function of cumulative exposure may underestimate the true effect of exposure on mortality whether or not one adjusts for the risk factor in the analysis. This observation raises the question, which if any population parameters can be given a causal interpretation in observational mortality studies? In answer, we offer a graphical approach to the identification and computation of causal parameters in mortality studies with sustained exposure periods. This approach is shown to be equivalent to an approach in which the observational study is identified with a hypothetical double-blind randomized trial in which data on each subject's assigned treatment protocol has been erased from the data file. Causal inferences can then be made by comparing mortality as a function of treatment protocol, since, in a double-blind randomized trial missing data on treatment protocol, the association of mortality with treatment protocol can still be estimated. We reanalyze the mortality experience of a cohort of arsenic-exposed copper smelter workers with our method and compare our results with those obtained using standard methods. We find an adverse effect of arsenic exposure on all-cause and lung cancer mortality which standard methods fail to detect.}

    abstract = { Censored data make survival analysis more complicated because exact event times are not observed. Statistical methodology developed to account for censored observations assumes that patients’ withdrawal from a study is independent of the event of interest. However, in practice, some covariates might be associated to both lifetime and censoring mechanism, inducing dependent censoring. In this case, standard survival techniques, like Kaplan–Meier estimator, give biased results. The inverse probability censoring weighted estimator was developed to correct for bias due to dependent censoring. In this article, we explore the use of inverse probability censoring weighting methodology and describe why it is effective in removing the bias. Since implementing this method is highly time consuming and requires programming and mathematical skills, we propose a user friendly algorithm in R. Applications to a toy example and to a medical data set illustrate how the algorithm works. A simulation study was carried out to investigate the performance of the inverse probability censoring weighted estimators in situations where dependent censoring is present in the data. In the simulation process, different sample sizes, strengths of the censoring model, and percentages of censored individuals were chosen. Results show that in each scenario inverse probability censoring weighting reduces the bias induced in the traditional Kaplan–Meier approach where dependent censoring is ignored. }

We construct an adaptive test that (i) is asymptotically distribution free under the null hypothesis of no treatment effect on survival, (ii) incorporates surrogate marker data, and (iii) is guaranteed to be locally more powerful than the ordinary log-rank test against proportional hazards alternatives when the baseline failure time distribution is Weibull.
